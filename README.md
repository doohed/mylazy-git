# Git Automation CLI

This command-line tool automates common Git commands to simplify your workflow.
<br/>
I just wanted to add a globally available command to do commits to my small projects

## Features

- Initializes Git repository if not already initialized.
- Automatically adds files, commits changes, sets up the main branch, adds remote origin, and pushes changes.
- Asks for a commit message to provide context for the changes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/doohed/mylazy-git

   ```

2. Move to the dir

   ```bash
   cd mylazy-git

   ```

3. Execute the installer script
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```

## Usage

Now you can use the script globally from any terminal

```bash
mylazy-git.py
```
